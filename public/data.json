Like, I knew a few people through Tumblr that I met in person for the first time on this day. I met people that I'd only ever see again at subsequent Zine fairs. I think this might have been like my first introduction to Sarah Firth’s  work. I think I picked up some stuff of hers there as well.\n\n**Gabe Clark:** Who is your community of practitioners now? Who do you talk with or share work with? Was this zine fair in Melbourne also the beginning of your relationship with the Sydney community.\n\n**MO:** Yeah, you know, my close crew are the Sydney Comics people. [pause] _Gabe McCabe_, yeah, Safdar [Ahmed], Can [Yalcincaya]. Those guys.\n\n**GC:** And so, these people that you met at this zine fair and the people in the Sydney crew — how do they influence your work?\n\n**MO:** I guess that we’re all involved in the same ridiculous pursuit of these, sort of, creative outcomes. I don't know.\n\n**GC:** Is that literally it? It’s the comradery that you provide for each other? Or is there actually feedback that you give to each other?\n\n**MO:** I still get like really self-conscious about feedback, even when it's with friends. But I think the main thing I really enjoy about hanging out with other comics people is being able to talk about like you know, specific like technical things or specific thing that we’ve all just read. There’s no need to catch anyone up. Everyone knows what's going on.\n\n**GC:** Do you mean like a book that's floating around that everyone is reading?\n\n**MO:** Yeah, yeah, like you know. “Oh, you read Habibi? That was that was Orientalist bull-shit.” or whatever.\n\n**GC:** You talked about materiality earlier. You were talking about working with a brush before. How do the tools that you use and the materials that you use impact your storytelling?\n\n**GC:** Going back to representation in your work and the way you depict people. You’re often drawing yourself into your stories. How have things changed in terms of the way you create the image of yourself in the stories?\n\n**MO:**  The next one I showed after this is this sketches. Compared to the sketches and stuff I did for.The comic I did for the nib. This is a lot more cartoonish.I, I think when I was trying to work out how to, you know, represent people for the nib comic  I was really struggling with how.To depict race because that was such a huge issue for the storytelling or a huge issue for the process behind that. \n\nIt's not something that I'd really dealt with visually before either. I was trying to put in more detail like you know, looking at face shapes and like nose shapes and.And that kind of thing.\n\n**GC:** So, one of things this interview series is interested comics people creating their own community infrastructure, I know you're involved in a couple of things. Tell us about the events or festivals organisations that you're involved in. What's your role in the Comic Arts Workshop?\n\n**MO:**  Oh God. Yeah, I guess I'm involved in the Comic Art Workshop. I will be going to the retreat in November unless COVID comes and fucks everything up again. I was actually approached by Eleri [Mai Harris] and Josh [Santospirito], who very much overestimated my capabilities to contribute to the project. Initially I was very excited because I do realise that it's like quite a special and unique thing.. but then .. I don't know dude, I'm having like a fucking crisis about comics… Ugh… This isn’t the best time for this interview.\n\n**GC:** OK. Bad time for this interview. But if you've been involved in the organisation though weren't you in the group that was reading through the application?\n\n**MO:** Yeah, so I could get more familiar with the organisation structure, I became part of the selection committee. I think it was Saf [Ahmed} and Can [Yalcinkaya]. We got the absolute pleasure of reading through peoples applications — full of blood, sweat and tears — And, you know, saying “maybe not?” or “Yeah”. Oh God, it was the fucking _worst_ thing I've done in my life.\n\n**GC:** So there was a group of three of you with it.Yeah, we.And then you guys had to just read the submissions and and discuss.Let's start with the Java OK.\n\n**MO:** We're also kind of aiming for thing like gender parity, like an even geographical spread, a diverse ethnic background spread, yes.\n\n**GC:** And that process was not easy, I imagine?\n\n**MO:** Fuckin’ horrific man.\n\n**GC:** Yeah, I often wonder how people choose which of the projects get grants and stuff. It’s kind of a this black art. How do they do it?\n\n**MO:** Also, I've realised through teaching that I don't actually have that much analytical ability.\n\n**GC:** What is Australian about comics about Australian comics? Is there an Australian thing? Is there a common thread or is everyone uniquely their own?\n\n**MO:** I think everyone is quite uniquely their own. I think Fionn might have brought this up in his interview, but I think it has a lot to do with like the commercial viability of comics in Australia, there's. There's no particular one style that will like guarantee you any sort of like commercial or professional success, so I guess it kind of frees people up in a way.\n\n**GC:** It seems as though that the way people represent Australia in Australian comics doesn't seem to be universal either, you can't always tell that something is even drawn in Australia.\n\n**MO:** Yeah I wonder if some of that might be the impact of the dominance of overseas comics as well, it's like we haven't been given a language to talk about Australia.\n\n**GC:** Yeah, there are definitely makers though, who do make American style comics and they often do tell Australian stories in them, but the story comes through this weird lens or filter that kind of distorts it. Which is very strange.\n \n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":5,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"Entering The Community","order":6,"LongFormCards":["recMsipbQr5s5NS5n"],"storyBy":"Meg O'Shea","name":"Meg O'Shea on Entering The Community","id":"interview_5"}},{"id":"interview_6","fields":{"Copy_rt":"**Gabe Clark:** Are there any particular places or events like this that have been important for you as a comics artist?\n\n**MO:** Yeah, Read To Me. The Raid to May at Ashfield Library at an event called “Comic Conversation”. When was it? like 2018? 2017? something like that? There were a lot of very cool comics people that I only knew from the Internet and was in awe of. I read a half-finished story and they were like: “YAY! This wasn't shit!” and I'm like:  “Oh God, thank you.”\n\n**GC:** It was a pretty fun event. That was the first read to me.\n\n**MO:** Really? Oh!\n\n**GC:** And there were like 100 people there — probably more — I think who were tabling at the event beforehand and because of that, the show, had a huge audience. I was pretty excited about it. What was it about _that _event that made it so impactful in your practice?\n\n**MO:** So, I guess first is the most like totally self-serving thing was that I presented a story in which I was more honest and more vulnerable than I ever been before in any of my work. That story got accepted by a lot of people that I'd really respected — and who I still respect.\n\nAfterwards we went to Dumplings because,  it's _Ashfield_, what else does anyone do in Ashfield? And we hung out and I just got to hang out with all these cool people, some of whom I now consider to be good friends. It was, just, a like nice feeling to be accepted by a creative community for doing this thing that I found to be the most enjoyable, and to be working in this medium that was the most gratifying of any of the mediums I'd tried up until then. These were people whose work I respected a lot as well, so yeah.\n\n**GC:** You're trained as an animator, right?\n\n**MO:** Right, yeah?\n\n**GC:** What is it about comics that is gratifying as compared to, say, animation?\n\n**MO:** Yeah, a lot of the times it is definitely the immediacy of comic. A lot of the comics I've made are kind of me needing to convey something like quite quickly, and on my own steam. Making comics is something you can do by yourself. You have an end product that you can potentially interact with as, like, a physical object. As a reader, you have control over like the temporality of the of the narrative and stuff through, you know, like turning pages or stopping scrolling and that kind of thing. So as a reader, it seems like a lot more intimate to me. But yeah, I kind of just said this, but it's something you can do by yourself, but since it's like image based, it's something you can also distribute quite easily. You can have an audience of very many people, like, quite quickly, I suppose it an easy way to talk to people, basically… when you're a sad lonely loser.\n\n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":6,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"That First \"Read To Me\"","order":7,"LongFormCards":["recMsipbQr5s5NS5n"],"pullQuote":"I don't know it was just like a nice feeling accepted by a creative community for like doing this thing, I found the most enjoyable and the most gratifying of any of the mediums I'd tried up until then","storyBy":"Meg O'Shea","name":"Meg O'Shea on That First \"Read To Me\"","id":"interview_6"}},{"id":"interview_7","fields":{"Copy_rt":"**Gabriel Clark:** What are you showing us now?\n\n**Me O’shea:** These are some sketches for a comic I did that ended up on The Nib (link). I guess I did these around 2017. I had been trying to work out what to do for my final project for Pat Grant’s Graphic Visualisation class at UTS. I was toying with this idea of a story about a reptilian character whose appearance doesn't match his, like, inner identity, because I'd been thinking more about my racial identity. At the end of at the end of semester Pat like took us all out. The whole class went out to Chinatown for dinner and Pat just like kind of asked, offhandedly: “Are you going to make more comics next? Is there anything you'd like to make comics about?”\n\nI was like: “Oh yeah, I guess, like,  you know, about being adopted” because I'd started thinking more about that stuff around that time.\n\nWith that in mind, I tricked myself into going onto this _First Trip Home_ tour for Korean adoptees which — kind of, as the name suggests — are these tours specifically designed for Korean adoptees going back to Korea for the first time. You normally go with a bunch of other adoptees and you do like a bunch of Korean shit.  You wear hanbok. You eat a bunch of Korean food. Blah blah blah.\n\nI told myself like — yeah, nah — this this will just be research for a comic. It's fine. I can be detached. I'll just go there and take in all the information I can. It'll be great.\nSo I went there and I had, like, an interesting time. I wasn't sure what to do with it.\n\n**GC:** So when was this again do? You know what year?\n\n**MO: **It was 2016 when I went back. That was also my last year of studying, which was probably a bad idea. I went during the mid year break and I came back and I finished my fucking animation degree.\n\nI wasn't really sure where to start with the comic so I just tried to collect and tried to draw the people had seen there work out how to draw them. I’m not actually very good at drawing. These are quite embarrassing now that I look at them.\n\n**GC:** So what tools are you using when you're? Doing these sketches.\n\n**MO:** Like LED pencil. This drawing this was a pentel pocket brush pen. Yeah, I think this drawing might have just been like a just like a $2.00 shop felt tip type thing. Think I was still using — fuck what are the dark red ones. The dark red felt tips. It's like a it's like a slightly less expensive uni ball.\n\nAlso, I’m sorry I just spat on you!\n\nCan’t remember where I was going with this.\n\n**GC:** I want to talk about the noses. Because you mentioned noses before?\n\n**MO:** Ah yeah, yeah.\n\nUhm, yeah, everyone still drawn with noses them at this stage, for whatever reason. The noses seem to be like a good, interesting shape to put on a face. Like a lot of a lot of the art that I was looking and had like cool noses.\n\n**GC:** And so this turned into a comic.\n\n**MO:** Yeah.\n\n**GC:** What was the comic called.\n\n**MO:** It was meant to be called _The M Word_, but it later got renamed by someone who is not me.\n\n**GC:** Was that… the publisher?\n\n**MO:** Yes. It got published on The Nib. It got published on the nib because I had half-made a comic about one of my days on the _First Trip Home_ tour, maybe the worst day there. I presented this half-finished story at an event called _Read To Me _at Comic Con-versation in Ashfield.\n\nBecause they got fucken roped into it by a couple of nerds. I presented the story people seem to like it. I didn't realise how much until later. I was really nervous at the event.\n\nI met Josh Santospirito, Eleri Mai Harris and Safthar [Ahmed] for the first time. I had only really heard about these people online, and I was like very starstruck.\n\nWe all ended up going to dumplings after and Eleri asked me if I'd want to finish the story I had presented for publication on _The Nib_. I, drunkenly, and enthusiastically said:  “Yes!”,  and then we ended up back at Fionn’s house, and Liam broke a bottle of whiskey.\n\n**GC:** You wanted to call it _The M Word_. What did they want? What did you change it to?\n\n**MO:** The title got changed to _A Part Of Me Is Still Unknown_, which is kind of like a slight retooling of one of the lines in the story.\n\n**GC:** And it's, uh, and that was published in _The Nib _in 2016?\n\n**MO:** 2018 it took me. It took Me 2 years to turn the bits and pieces I had into anything coherent.\n\n**CG: **And it got nominated for some awards didn’t it?\n\n**MO: **Oh yeah, It got nominated for an Ignatz for web comic.\n\n**GC:** So, the story had an impact, and you found an audience. You said earlier that you were surprised by that. Why were you surprised?\n\n**MO: **I don't know. I guess I hadn't really anticipated everyone anyone would give that much of a shot about it.\n\n**GC:** And so, who do you think your audience was then? When you were writing it.\n\n**MO:** I'm not actually sure. I suppose anyone would want to like listen or read it. I feel like every time I have like some sort of internal dialogue like. The sentences turn out in a way that it seems like I do anticipate like some sort of audience, but there wasn’t any specific one that I had in mind.\n\n**GC:** Right, and so you're thinking of an audience you’re performing the comic at a reading, but you're not thinking of an audience when you're alone writing a story?\n\n**MO:** I guess I think of writing a story as though I am, like, talking to someone, maybe? If that makes sense.\n\n**GC:** Is that a recurring part of your process? Do you usually write as though you are talking to someone?\n\n**MO:** I think so. A lot of the time I write like I'm trying to explain myself or explain something that's happened. Maybe I’m just, like, talking to myself really elaborately and people listen-in. I don't know know.\n\n**GC:** And so when you made this comic, How was this one different from the other ones you've made previously? What were the techniques and material kind of things that are unique about the process for this one. What did you learn it?\n\n**MO:** I guess it was longer than previous comics. I guess it was kind of more, _factual_. I was using, fuck, what do you call them? Crow Quills? One of those dip pens that has a brass bit on top that holds a little reservoir of ink. I had realised that I liked a lot of flatter looking artwork with thinner lines. I'd been using a lot of brushes and brush pens before, but I realised they liked to work with thinner lines, so I tried to do that. This whole comic was another big experiment in a style which I really don't like any more.\n\n**GC: **Which of these drawings in front of us are in that style that you don't like anymore?\n\n**MO:**  Oh, all of them. I mean, like, I guess these ones are okay because they are still sketchy but anything with the nose is bad. Anything with like brush lines is bad.\n\n**GC:** You first presented this story at Read To Me, which was a slide show. And then you published it as a single-scroll web comic. How did laying out the story for these different formats affect the story?\n\n**MO:** The layout effected it bunch actually. There was a first draft I sent to Eleri of the full story. I had actually, like, sneakily designed it to be printable as a really, really long concertina comic. Because I  like concertina comics and I had previously made _The wolves of King Street _as the final work for Pat’s Class and that was a concertina comic. I had really enjoyed that project, and I thought: “Huh, I'll do it the same way. Then I can _print_ it. It'll be another zine, so then I’ll have three zines I can sell.\n\nBut yeah, obviously I had to retool the story that for the single scroll. Through doing that I realised how important it was to, kind-of, enforce pauses in the layout because you don’t have some sort of like physical page like structure, and that kind of thing, UM.\n\nI realised how much like, inconsistencies in the line weight bothered me because _The Nib_ has this web template that re-sizes panels automatically depending if it's on the screen size that it is displaying on, you know. So, if you look at the piece on a phone there's are some panels that have been scaled down and others that have been scaled up. So there are blocks of hand-written text next to each other that have, like, wildly different line widths and I fucking hate it.\n\n**GC:** I remember you presenting this story for the first time at Read To Me and thinking about how well you had played with the format of a slide show. You understood how the constraints of a medium can kind of be utilised. Were you just trying to add the same pacing and the same pauses in the different mediums or did these things change from medium to medium?\n\n**MO:** The pauses and the need for that particular pacing came from the story itself, in both of the formats. I think like the pacing normally comes from the writing for me, but also at around the same time presented the story at that Ashfield, Read to Me I was doing an animation job that was essentially glorified slideshows, so, so that probably had a lot to do with the way the story came out then.\n\n**GC:** You knew how to play with the medium.\n\n**MO:** Yeah.\n\n**GC:** This is a very personal story about you and your identity and your family. How did your family feel about this story? But also, or how do they feel about your love of comics?\n\n**MO:** Well, my love of comics has gotten me employment, and that's the main thing my mum seems to be concerned about. I don't know. I'm not actually sure how they feel about the content. Neither of my parents are very like open about their feelings and sometimes when I have tried to talk about adoption related stuff with them — mostly my mum again — It has turned into, you know,  not happy discussions. Not calm discussions. It's obviously, like, a very sensitive topic for both of us, but they haven't said anything openly. They have told me that they have read some of the stuff they might say, you know, “it's a sensitively told story” or “I'm glad your skills are being recognised”.\n\nI’m like:  “OK, cool, I guess that's it then”.\n\nOh God.\n\n**GC:** Interesting that you are talking about your family and your identity as well as your racial identity, What kind of issues of representation do you come across when you're drawing people in people in Korea and people in Australia. When you come across particular representational problems while you are drawing, how do you deal with them?\n\n**MO:** Oh God, I'm still not sure. I know it's like a huge issue because. Drawing in any sort of comic style is trying to find a visual shorthand for stuff? Yeah, it's tricky. I think like I realised in Korea\n\nA lot of a lot of the things that affected my reading of people — particularly other adoptees — whether they were Western looking or Korean looking, depended on, like, their clothing and how they styled their hair and that kind of thing. So, when I’ve been drawing I've tried to put more emphasis on like the way people have their hair and the way they are dressed rather than on any essential physical features.\n\nBut, fuck. It’s hard. Especially like I don't know like a lot of the styles I was looking at previously have just drawn white people. You can make the eyes look however, you can make the face look however, and it's just going to read as like a white person most of the time so… ugh…I’m not being very articulate about this.\n\n**GC:** Is there anything else you want to add about why this story was important for you?\n\n**MO:** Presenting this story at Read to Me allowed me to like make a bunch of people that you I really respect, but also, like, I now consider friends, I suppose.\n\n**GC:  **And how do those people influence you? What is it about this community that influences you?\n\n**MO:** I don't know, I should stop referring to the interview we did with Fionn but as he said, you know. This group of people seems to be like a very, like, _chill_, compared to other creative communities. These artists are very uncompetitive and very open. I don't know. I fell in love with the medium and it's just like cool having people you can talk with about a thing that you're all in love with.\n\n\n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":7,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"Her First Story About adoption and Korea","order":8,"LongFormCards":["recMsipbQr5s5NS5n"],"pullQuote":"I tricked myself into going onto this First Trip Home tour for Korean adoptees... \nI told myself like — yeah, nah — this this will just be research for a comic.

Where were you? Tell us about this pile of diary comics.\n\n**MO:** These were all diary comics done between 2019 and 2021 while I was living in Korea. Also, under the pretence of doing research for a graphic novel.\n\n**GC:** Which city were you in?\n\n**MO:** I was in Seoul.\n\n**GC:** Were you working?\n\n**MO:** Yeah, I was teaching teaching English to children and a couple of adults at various points during my time there.\n\n**GC:** OK, so, you're living in Seoul. Were you there on your own?\n\n**MO:** No, I was with my partner Liam.\n\n**GC:** We could talk about the drawings first, I've noticed that there are no noses.\n\n**MO:** Fuck noses. Get out of here.\n\n**GC:** What is it about these comics that you like stylistically?\n\n**MO:** I found a way to work that was less, _painful_ and just looks less ugly. I don't know. I hope you can agree with that.\n\n**GC:** Absolutely. What are the steps then to to this pain free way of working?\n\n**MO:** It kind of varies. Some of these are diary comics and I wanted to do them as quickly as possible. For others I had bought some coloured card for some craft activities with my students. I noticed on like the reverse side of the cards that there was a 5 millimetre grid. I’m like: “Cool”. I cut myself some squares out of that and I would draw the outline of a square panel in blue pencil. Then like go around it with pen. I'm using a Tikki Rotring Graphic for these ones now.\n\nSome other comics were done in notebooks. Korean Daiso is fucking amazing and always has shitloads of notebooks. The ones they sell have these nice thin pages, so all you really have to is your even sided square panel once and then just trace it onto each page. It's super quick and maybe quite lazy but — yeah — less fucking around means more like coherent drawings, right?\n\n**GC: **So how many drawings to you reckon you made in these diary comics?\n\n**MO:** Good question. I dunno. A fair few.\n\n**GC:** Hundreds? Thousands?\n\n**MO:** Maybe. I don't know actually.\n\n**GC:** So maybe talk us through one panel. Is there any panel here you want to talk to you about? A story moment or a moment where something interesting was happening with the drawing.\n\n**MO: **There is one particular page that stands out. One from early on in the stay in Korea. I was before we had a rental place in Seoul and before we had a chance to get ourselves set up with stuff. I had no access to a computer. I was still making diary comics, but I was using this scanner app on my phone, right? So, I wasn't able to use the paint bucket tool in Photoshop to fill in the larger areas that I wanted to be black, so I was still like using my pentel pocket to fill in the areas I want it to be black.\n\n**GC:** And what are the stories that you're telling in this page?\n\n**MO:** This one was drawn, maybe, two or three weeks into living in Korea. Before we arrived I had felt a lot of pressure around, like, race and stuff. It was because of what was going on with politics at home in Australia and, like, a few racist incidents that I had experience personally, that kind of thing. So, one of the things I really enjoyed after getting to Korea was that we had entered a new social context and a new political context. It felt like kind of like a nice holiday, as horrible as that sounds.\n\nIt was awesome, just to be on the outside of that, and instead to be distracted with — you know — finding furniture, or, like, finding a doona that meant you wouldn’t freeze to death in a Korean winter.\n\nBut then the Christchurch shooting happened and that was so much of a reminder of the shitty-ness of Australia. International white supremacy and all that fun stuff came back to me. So this comic was about that feeling.\n\nOh look! I gave Fraser Anning and Peter Dutton and Pauline Hanson noses. Actually, if I draw white characters, they all have noses. [nervous Laughter] Ahh! Anyway.\n\n**GC:** interesting.\n\n**MO:** Yeah.\n\n**GC:** And so there's a sense of distance from Australia, but then also a sense horror at the politics. Being so new to Seoul did you feel a similar sense of immunity to the politics and the issues in Korea?\n\n**MO:** Yeah, there was definitely an element of that for a while but not the whole time. Later on I started learning more about local politics.\n\n**GC:** Did you find you were exposed to any politics or any issues around Korean Adoptees through your work with the adoption agency?\n\n**MO:** Kind of. Not really. Not really anything I hadn't known before I go to Korea.\n\nI guess more of the new political stuff I learned about Korea while I was there was more to do with issues of elderly elderly welfare. They have a shitty welfare and old age pension system there. In Korea there are also all these issues to do with workers and that kind of thing.\n\n**GC:** And what about communities of comics makers? Did you come across any of that in Korea?\n\n**MO**: No, like. Interacting with any non-English speaking communities in Korea was obviously really difficult.\n\nUhm, I met a few people involved with Fine Arts communities through an adoptee that I knew in Seoul. There were also these, you know, expat arts communities which are mostly Americans.\nSo, there's a huge like commercial comics industry in Korea. I think that if any young person wants to do comics or, you know, feels drawn to comics. They'll probably just start making web-toons to be commercially viable rather than forming into an independent comics community in the same way that they would in Australia, I suppose.\n\nThere were some, like, small press illustration books and a few comics like that.\n\nThere might be a huge community in Koreal that I don't know about as well.\n\n**GC:** That stuff, usually reveals itself to you usually in the last week that you're in a country.\n\n**MO:** Actually, sorry, one more thing to mention with these comics pages. One of the reason they have this format is because I was starting to make like everything for Instagram. This was my main means of like staying connected to like the comics community, my friends and stuff I had back home\n\n**GC:** You mean the square panelled format?\n\n**MO:** Yeah, yeah.\n\n**GC:** It reminds me of Mandy Ord’s diary comics. She did four panels a day.\n\n**MO:** Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n**GC:** And are these like that? Did you make a comic a day or something like that?\n\n**MO:** No, no set schedule. Just as stuff happened like. Again,  because I feel like I'm not that good at — you know — talking about stuff, verbally, it felt like this was a good way to update people back home on what was going on.\n\n**GC:** So location is a big part of these diary comics because you're in a new place.What’s your process for incorporating place based images into the stories?\n\n**MO:** I don't know, just putting some Korean shit in.\n\n**GC:** But do you take reference photos? Are you watching and observing?\n\n**MO:** Uhm, I normally. I do take a lot of photos. If there's something I'm going to forget, but with most of these diary comics, I feel like I could just observe and, kind of, wing it.\nDuring the first year in Korea, if I was out somewhere and something vaguely interesting is happening, I guess I would try and pay more attention to the environment. I'm like: “Oh, maybe I want to turn this into a comic” or like: “Maybe this is important and I shouldn't forget it.”\n\n**GC:** Are you drawing what you're seeing, or are you just looking and remembering.\n\n**MO:** Literally just looking remembering a lot of the time. Or taking very stealthy photos sometimes.\n\n**GC:** your brain must be very visual.\n\n**MO:** Yeah, I don't know. I probably should have done something differently to remember this trip because I've forgotten so much now. Oh God.\n\n**GC:** But that's an amazing process like to see how your dieary comics are made. It makes me I just want to read them, to pick them up in this sketchbook format. You should publish it like that with a ring binder.\n\n**GC:** Can we come back to representation? Earlier we talked about the way that you draw white people with noses. Do you think there is a real issue of representation in comics? Is it an issue with Australian comics? Or is it cartooning in general. What do you what do you reckon?\n\n**MO:** I think cartooning, in general, is quite a complicated thing.\n\nI don't like drawing in very complex ways. I like drawing like very simply because I don't like taking a lot of time with stuff, I suppose. And — you know — having to have those visual short-hands_ does _make representation an issue.\n\n**GC: **But if it’s** **a visual shorthand that is your own _style_ and it’s not a trope. That's a different problem that you're solving right?\n\n**MO:** The difficult thing is, just, trying to make a characters read clearly, to be identifiable as part of a specific ethnic community.\n\n**GC:** Is there anything else you want to add about these diary comics.\n\n**MO:** I don't know like. I really did feel when I was in Korea these comics were my main way of keeping in contact with people.\n\n**GC:** I remember looking at them on instagram when you uploaded them. They were great. They're very effective in doing that.\n\n**MO:** Yeah. I'm glad I did them as well. I try to keep a written diary as well and there are a lot of kind of small details that haven’t really been conveyed in the diary, that I can look at in these comics and drawings. Like, look at this water bottle in this panel. That's like in every single Korean restaurant.\n\n**GC:** Right.\n\n**MO:** This kind of bowl. Like I remember what that sunflower painting in the background looked like. I'm glad I drew them.\n\n**GC: **And what's so what's next for the Korea story? Are you still trying to battle it? \n\n**MO:** Oh God. [pause] Yeah, I dunno.\n\n**GC:** No, real plan or anything?\n\n**MO:** I'm going to the Comic Art Workshop this November [2022], so, I want to have something done by then to make it look semi worthwhile, but I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. I realise I need therapy before I can write on a bunch of it.\n\n**GC:** It _this_ therapy?\n\n**MO:** Oh my God, NO! Another thing about like the fact that like the these sketches for like _A Part Of Me Is Still Unknown_. I feel like, because that was a story that required me to like pull a large chunk of my guts out and put them on a page and that was the story that like made people go: “Oh, you're alright at making comics”. It created this really shitty link. Oh waid. Not shitty. Not link. [pause] I don't know. A lot of the things that I make that feel valuable to me are the things that are the most… _trying…_\n\n**GC:** Or vulnerable or something?\n\n**MO:** Yeah. It _is_ therapeutic to do this, sometimes, but it's also like I have painted myself into a corner. The only thing I'm going to find fulfilling to make is going to be this thing that like…[pause]\n\n**GC:** That exploits your own vulnerabilities.\n\n**MO:** I guess so. Sometimes it's hard to tell if it's if it's if it's beneficial because when I tell stories about adoption it’s never that _fun_. But then people will be like: “Oh, Thank you for this. I learned from this.” And I'm like: “Fucking awesome, everyone should know what’s going on. We should, like, shut down international adoption.” Whatever.\n\n**GC:** And do you reckon that's a common thing with writing? Do you think there's a vulnerability in simply being a creative writer?\n\n**MO:** Yeah, suppose like the there is. Particularly with autobio stuff. Obviously.

It’s called Blood and Thunder #2. I only really realised the significance of this anthology of like a few years after I got it. It was printed by blood and Thunder, which I just realised was only two people, Leigh Rigozzi and Kernow Craig. I thought maybe Mickie Quick was part of that for some reason.\n\n**GC:** So what was blood and Thunder?\n\n**MO:** They were a print collective based mostly around a risograph machine. As far as I could tell that they did have some, like other interesting contraptions.\n\n**GC:** The Blood and Thunder risograph machine went on to become the Rizzeria.\n\n**MO:** Did it?\n\n**GC: **Yeah\n\n**MO:** Oh, what the Fuck?... OK.\n\n**GC:** So this risograph machine has been on a bit of a journey.\n\n**MO:** I didn't know that.\n\nSo, my partner, Liam, was co-directing — in a “Renew Newcastle” style way — this space. It was once an air conditioning factory and it was about to be developed in Roselle. Around the time that Liam and I first got together Blood and Thunder had a residency in some of the studios that were downstairs in that building. I had just Just finished art school at School of Contemporary Arts where Leigh Rigozzi had been my teacher. Am I saying his name wrong?\n\n**GC:** Rigg-ott-sea… That's how I say it. It could be Rigg-ohh-sea.\n\n**MO:** Leigh Rigg-oht-sea?\n\n**GC:** Let us know Leigh. If you're reading this transcript. Let us know. \n\n**MO:** Jesus. Yeah, so, like — for me — This studio was a place where I'd hang around with friends before and after parties. We’d do stuff like decorate the sides of stupid sound systems, but there were people working there at Blood and Thunder and also Monster Mouse in studios beneath. I'd see Leigh down there sometimes. And I'd say hi and there would be, like, this big, weird machine doing stuff up the back of the studio, but I was too scared to go in there. Like, “What's going on in there? Ha ha ha”.\n\nI knew leigh was a Sydney comics guy at that point, just because I’d met him at uni, but I didn't really have that much interest in comics at that stage. I was still coming out of that, kind of, _contemporary art _practice that I was exposed to at uni. But yeah, Liam, my partner would talk to Leigh and Kernow a bunch.\n\nThey printed this book when they had a residency at that place in Rozelle called Anyplace Projects. We went to the launch of the book and Liam bought copy, and it just kind of sat on the shelf looking pretty for ages. I come to back to it _now_ and I'm like, “oh fuck!”. Now, I recognise the work of every single artist in here. And now I have so much more of an appreciation for what each of these works are doing, and like how they were put together, and, like, I now know what a risograph machine is.\n\n**GC:** So what's risograph machine?\n\n**MO:** It’s a type of printer. It’s like a cross between a screen printing machine and a photo copier? It puts down layers of single colours to make very cool images, yeah?\n\n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":9,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"That Blood and Thunder Anthology","order":10,"LongFormCards":["recMsipbQr5s5NS5n"],"pullQuote":"There were people working there at Blood and Thunder and there would be, like, this big, weird machine doing stuff up the back of the studio, but I was too scared to go in there.","storyBy":"Meg O'Shea","name":"Meg O'Shea on That Blood and Thunder Anthology","id":"interview_9"}},{"id":"interview_10","fields":{"Copy_rt":"**GC:** So is there any particular story in this anthology that stands out or influenced you?\n\n**MO:** I don't know if there is a single one. I just love looking back on the book now and seeing so much of this stuff because I can see how people styles have changed, right? I mean the story called, _Judy_, by Lachlan Conn is just frigging insane. It's just, like, next level to look at. When I was down in Tassie Leigh just like _gave_ me a like a printed copy of the zine version with just the _Judy_ story. I tried to give him money for it and he’s like: “No, no just have it”. I'm like: “Oh my God”.\n\nI like to see the way different styles have developed since then or, sometimes, styles that have remained consistent. When I was going through my zines I found this really old anthology edited by Simon Hanselmann called _Victoria Drug Scene_. It’s one of those ones I picked up at a zine fare 'cause I liked the cover. yeah, but yeah, it's just got like stuff from Simon and Michael Fikaris and, like, a bunch of other people who’s styles have changed completely now. It's just so nice to look back at.\n\n**GC:** Michael Fikaris has a great book which is basically all of his old comics combined together as an anthology. It’s an anthology of his own work! It's amazing to read because on the first page he is trying to draw like what he thinks comics are and their last page he now at his contemporary style. It's mind-blowing to read the whole book where you can see someone journey developing style and storytelling and through iteration. It's wonderful.\n\n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":10,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"Memorable Moments","order":11,"LongFormCards":["recMsipbQr5s5NS5n"],"storyBy":"Meg O'Shea","name":"Meg O'Shea on Memorable Moments","id":"interview_10"}},{"id":"interview_11","fields":{"Copy_rt":"**GC:** _Blood and Thunder #2_ is a book that is noteworthy in its materiality. How important, are material aspects in reading a comic like this?\n\n**MO:** Hugely important. It just it makes things feel intimate, being able to _hold _something and feel and then have control of the pace at which you go through it. My God. Just like being able to stop and pause and sit on an image for ages. That is just Awesome.\n\n**GC:** When you do stop and pause on an image, would it be because of the type of printing? Is it just the drawing? Ot is it because it's a story moment? What do you think is having the most impact there?\n\n**MO:** A lot of the time, I guess it's kind of like the amount of detail in an image that make you pause. If you're reading like a longer work and you also just need to take a pause think about what's just happened. That's a reason to stop a lot of the time. A lot of the time, the thing that makes you stop is an appreciation of a technical aspect of the comic.\n\n**GC:** You mentioned you picked up the _Victoria Drug Scene _anthology, because it had a good cover.\n\n**MO: **Oh yeah. Maybe that was in during a 2015 trip to Melbourne. I didn't know about a lot of the artists to look out for. So, I’m like: “Oh, this is an anthology. It's going to have like a bunch of people I might like. I'll give it a shot.”\n\nBut, getting back to the materiality thing.

What are the differences in in the two different mediums?\n\n**MO:** You get more immediate feedback from social media. In terms of like creating for social media, in a way, there's slightly less pressure with social media to make it look really nice because you can just say: “Oh, yeah, made this tonight. Put it on Instagram. Whatever.”\n\n**GC:** Do you find there is anxiety or pressure on the internet? Have you found it facilitates, kind of, awkward interactions with people, in regards to your work?\n\n**MO: **Not so much online. I mean, people sometimes take a message I hadn't intended from my work. That can be a bit awkward, but most awkward things tend to come when people have seen my work online and then I see them in real life. It's normally the worst thing.

Just seeing, like, little Southern crosses on the guard’s gear is really intense and cool.\n**GC:** Why do you think that works for you?\n\n**MO:** I think maybe just because we're probably mostly going to be exposed to comics from the states, so it's just, _nice_ seeing something that's like familiar like that.\n\n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":14,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"an Australian Voice in Comics","order":15,"LongFormCards":["recMsipbQr5s5NS5n"],"storyBy":"Meg O'Shea","name":"Meg O'Shea on an Australian Voice in Comics","id":"interview_14"}},{"id":"greatPanel_19","fields":{"Copy_rt":"I really like the way that the potato peelers feels alive.\n","storyType":["greatPanel_"],"number":19,"status":"stub","card":true,"bigText":"The way Trig Nifkins Drew That Potato Peeler","storyBy":"Wayne Willis","name":"Wayne Willis on The way Trig Nifkins Drew That Potato Peeler","id":"greatPanel_19"}},{"id":"artefact_20","fields":{"Copy_rt":"Have a gander at all this!\n","storyType":["artefact_"],"number":20,"status":"stub","card":true,"bigText":"This Poster from back in the day","storyBy":"Moz Wozzknit","name":"Moz Wozzknit on This Poster from back in the day","id":"artefact_20"}},{"id":"imgBanner_21","fields":{"Attachments":[{"id":"attY0wdDvxrkObsEM","width":3020,"height":3021,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7b6f0dbdacdad77af087f6c1510f51b5/11c9b229/imgBanner_21.jpeg","filename":"imgBanner_21.jpeg","size":4748969,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f74f8d3dd7028703b7635f2780a5443a/fdec9622","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b153b4b9314ad7af953969a1c69b8dad/537a1912","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a0413de89b845404689b7f2de0c668aa/a5a99ea3","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"storyType":["imgBanner_"],"number":21,"status":"in_progress","bigText":"The Gavin Aung Than Interview","order":1,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"storyBy":"Gabe Clark","name":"Gabe Clark on The Gavin Aung Than Interview","id":"imgBanner_21"}},{"id":"interview_22","fields":{"Copy_rt":"**Gabriel Clark:** Maybe we'll just start with biographical information. Do you want to introduce yourself?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yep. So yeah, my name's Gavin Aung Than. I'm a full-time cartoonist and I'm from Perth originally. Born and raised here. I spent about 11 years in Melbourne, moved back to Perth four years ago. And currently I'm working on a graphic novel series for First Second in the US. \n\nI guess I'm most well-known for my webcomic, which was <span id=\"insertCardID\">Zen Pencils</span>, which launched in 2012. That was my attempt, after dreaming and trying to be a cartoonist since I was about 18, I launched Zen Pencils. I quit my nine to five job, launched this webcomic – it was peak webcomic time around the world. \n\nI launched this webcomic and just gave it everything I had, and thankfully very lucky that it caught on. It built an audience and I managed to transition from being a graphic designer to a full-time cartoonist. Thankfully it's been over 10 years now and I'm still eking out a living drawing the comics. That's always been my dream to do that. And I'm very thankful that I still get to do it. \n\n**GC: **What year was Zen Pencils started?  \n\n**GAT:** That was 2012. So, I did that full time for six years, pretty much. It just was an all-consuming project. I did everything, all the web design the admin, the emails and the comics, obviously. \n\nAnd I used to write these essays with each comic. So, the whole gist of the website was I took quotes from other people, and I adapted them into comics. And there wasn't an overarching narrative. Each comic was its own thing that could be shared on social media. So, this was also when Twitter and Facebook were exploding, and people were sharing stuff, retweeting stuff a lot. \n\nSo, I used the model mainly from The Oatmeal. I dunno if you've heard of The Oatmeal, Matthew Inman's webcomic. Very successful. I took his model where he did short-form comics where each comic was its own thing that people could share. They didn't have to know anything about comics or a storyline or anything like that. They were easily digestible and shareable, and he would sell prints of each comic.\n\nSo, I did that as well. I sold posters of the comics. He eventually got a book deal, and I eventually got a book deal through the same publisher (as the Otmeal). So yeah, there were four Zen Pencils books that were published through Andrews McMeel, which is a big-time comic strip publisher. \n\nI got to travel to various cities around the world. I did a book tour in the US and I went to Asia. I did lots of meetups with Zen Pencils readers. I got to go to India a few times, the Comic-Con there, and yeah, it basically changed my life. This Zen Pencils webcomic. I did that for six years and eventually I, for various reasons, I wanted to move more into writing my own stories and drawing my own stories. So that's what I'm focusing on now is kids’ graphic novels. \n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":22,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"Starting the Zen Pencils Webcomic.","order":2,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"storyBy":"Gavin Aung Than","name":"Gavin Aung Than on Starting the Zen Pencils Webcomic.","id":"interview_22"}},{"id":"pullQuote_23","fields":{"Copy_rt":"Test copy\n","storyType":["pullQuote_"],"number":23,"status":"in_progress","order":3,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"pullQuote":"it basically changed my life.

This Zen Pencils webcomic. I did that for six years and eventually I, for various reasons, I wanted to move more into writing my own stories and drawing my own stories. So that's what I'm focusing on now is kids’ graphic novels. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** So that's a remarkable success. So when you first started making comics at 18, what were you making then?\n\n**GAT:** So the dream was to be a comic strip artist Jim Davis or Bill Watterson, who's one of my heroes, which I'll talk about later with one of the artifacts.\n\nThat was the dream. So, I bought this book, _How To Become a Professional Comic Strip Artist_. I did various strips – this was back when people read newspapers, those days. I worked in a newspaper for my job as well, so I knew about newspapers. I would be sending samples off to syndicates. Andrews McMeel was one, Universal, Uclick. The model was: you send them a pitch and they buy the strip and then they sell it to all the newspapers around the US and you become Jim Davis. You buy a private jet and stuff like that. That was the model. \n\nBut looking back, I got rejection letters and stuff like that and, being from Perth didn't help things. Living on the other side of the world. There wasn't much of a Australian comics scene. Not that I knew of anyway. \n\nThen I went to uni to do graphic design and I did illustration as well as a minor here in Perth. So then after uni I tried to get a job as a graphic designer. Eventually I did, in the newspaper industry. A big newspaper in Perth, which was the _Sunday Times_, which was the biggest weekly newspaper here. They have a comic strip section, obviously. They had a big double page spread every week. And I knew the editor of the comics kids section, so I went, ‘Hey, I can do a comic. Why don’t you publish my comic?’ So they did. So, I had a weekly strip in the newspaper called ‘Dan and Pete,’ which was like a superhero comic. That ran every week for five years.\n\nSo that was what I tell people was my apprenticeship. That really helped that I did over 300 strips. Having that deadline every week built up that discipline that you need. They need that strip every week. There's a blank section in the paper that needs to be filled. They're not gonna take no for an answer, so you need to have that strip. I got paid like 50 bucks for it. It was done at home in my spare time, and that's where I got the reps in, I guess.\n\nEventually I moved to Melbourne. I worked in newspapers there. And I got another strip published in that newspaper, a different strip which is more of a tongue-in-cheek dating strip. _[‘Boys will be Boys,’ published in the Herald Sun _-ed._]. _I did over 200 of those, every week. \n\nThe plan was that someone, I don't know who, would notice, this magnificent comic strip in the newspaper every week and say, ‘Give this man all the money! He needs to do more comics, this guy.’ That was the hope. That never happened. \n\nI was burning myself out. I was working at a regular full-time job as a graphic designer. I was doing two strips every week, and then webcomics were all the rage back so I turned them into webcomics. I was putting them online every week as well, those two strips. And so, I learned how to code, how to build a website, how to build a WordPress website. I was lucky to have a few hundred readers online. \n\n\n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":25,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"Breaking into Newspaper Comic Strips","order":5,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"pullQuote":"They need that strip every week.

If it's not working, how do you reflect or work that out? \n\n**GAT:** Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know. Just from a gut instinct. I guess when I would post on Zen Pencils, I would post multiple times a week and there'd be like a lot of feedback on each strip. The danger was listening too much to the feedback, where you'd let the audience control what you do with your work. Whereas the egoistical part of me says, ‘I know what I'm doing, I'm the artist. So, you just shut up and read the damn comic!’ [_laughing]_\n\nNo, some of the readers have been very thoughtful. One of the good things was that, in the early days of Zen Pencils – I didn't notice it, but the audience did – was most of the people I would borrow quotes from were just old white dudes. And I never really looked at it like that. Because, obviously, I took a lot of scientists, I took a lot of historical figures, and they're mostly older white dudes. Eventually I did about 40 or 50. And then a lot of people were saying, ‘Why don't you do more women? Why don't you do more people of colour?’ I was like, ‘That's a good point. I'm a person of colour. Why don't I do more people of colour?’ So that was a good eye-opening experience for me. They taught me what to work on. \n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":28,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"Listening To Readers","order":8,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"pullQuote":"a lot of people were saying, ‘Why don't you do more women?

Do you wanna start with the zine?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** So this is my first real comic book that I've made. [‘Devil Hands’]\n\nSo, this was made as my final year illustration project at uni, where we would have a big exhibition at the end of the year. I think I printed 300 of these. And I gave them away as free gifts at the end-of-year exhibition. \n\nI was really into martial arts as a teenager and I used to obsess over kung-fu movies and stuff like that. And I was training as well. The comic’s a pretty basic kung-fu revenge tale. This kind of started it all I guess. My dad was a printer. So he printed it for me and he helped me make it, so that's why it also has meaning as well, because he made it.\n\nThis started it all because even though no publisher wanted to publish it or anything like that, for my first interview after uni – my graphic design interview – I included this in my resumé. Eventually my boss said the reason I was hired was because he thought this was pretty well done, and it had nice design in it, and he was just impressed by it. So that led to me working in newspapers, that led to me getting those comic trips published. That led to me moving to Melbourne. So yeah, this all came from this. \n\n**Meg O’Shea: **So, your family was pretty supportive of your graphic design?\n\n**GAT:** No, I wouldn't go that far. No, they weren't that supportive of the whole cartooning thing. That's why I did graphic design, really. Cause they said, ‘You gotta go to university, you gotta get a good job’. They wanted me to be an architect cause ‘Oh, that's uses some sort of artistic skill. You're an artist.’\n\n And I was like, ‘No, I don't want to draw houses. I wanna draw people punching each other.’\n\nEventually I did go to uni. That was just expected, that I would go to university, and get a quote unquote ‘normal job’. At the time I was rebellious against them. But as a parent now – they migrated here and they worked hard for me and my brother to have a good life and go to a nice school and be able to go to university. So, I get it now. I'm not so harsh on them now, but at the time I was like, ‘Don't you know I'm gonna be a cartoonist?’ \n\n**MO: **And you are, and you’re successful! So, who’s right and who’s wrong?\n\n**GC:** So, what was the process of learning to make comics in this project? What were you going through here? \n\n**GAT:** Looking back on it is, it's quite crude, the actual art. I don't know, I just figured you do a 20-something page issue, and my dad helped me do the production and stuff like that.\n\n**GC:** Did you do it in a traditional way, was it drawn in ink?\n\n**GAT:** Yeah, it was all done in ink. Ink on board. The colours [_on the cover_] are done in Photoshop. That was also good about university. I learned how to use Photoshop. Probably the main the main takeaway from that, which I still use pretty much every day. \n\n**GC:** Can you step us through a panel maybe? \n\n**GAT:** Yeah. So, I trained in kung-fu back when I made this, and I actually got all my friends to do all the poses with me. I took photo references and stuff like that. So yeah, it was just a good time to combine my two obsessions, which was martial arts and comics. \n\nFrank Miller’s _Sin City _was a big influence. So, I was just trying to use as much black as possible. Jeff Smith as well, his _Bone_, black-and-white as well. So those were the two main artistic influences. \n\n**GC:** And what about learning around hierarchy or page flow or accessibility? Were you conscious of that stuff?\n\n**GAT:** I don't know. No. That just comes from reading comics, I guess since I was a kid. In my teenage years, I was an obsessive collector of comics. From osmosis, I guess you figure out how to pace a page.\n\n","storyType":["interview_"],"number":29,"status":"in_progress","card":true,"bigText":"Devil Hands","order":9,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"pullQuote":"Eventually my boss said the reason I was hired was because he thought this was pretty well done, and it had nice design in it, and he was just impressed by it.

That was my favourite place in the world when I was a teenager, early twenties. I would go there every few weeks and blow a lot of money that I didn't have.\n\n**Meg O’Shea**: So I’m guessing it’s not there anymore?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** It's still there actually. They've moved. I haven't been there in a few years, which is embarrassing to say. Just a traditional direct to retailer comic shop. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** How was it working with your dad to try and do the printing? Did you actually get to go to the printer and did he facilitate you through that process? \n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah, so my dad – I think I must get his sense of independence – he opened up his own print shop in our house actually. We had the print shop. He had a little room extension on the house. So, I would help him, even though I hated it. I would, reluctantly. I would help with the typesetting. What would we use back then? QuarkXPress. God, I hate QuarkXPress. I get nightmares thinking about it.\n\n**Gabriel Clark:** Occasionally a cheesecake recipe comes up and it asks for quark cheese, and all I can think of is desktop publishing software.\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** So, I would help my dad in his business, and I was there when he was printing the pages. This comic [‘Devil Hands’] means a lot to me. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** So, it was a family business running from the back of the house?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah. My mum helped with the bookkeeping and stuff.\n\n**Gabriel Clark:** So, would it have been offset printing? \n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah, he had a two-colour machine. If you had to print four colours, you have to run it through the press twice. He started off with a one-colour machine outta my bedroom, which was illegal. He kicked me outta my bedroom. I had to change bedrooms. And then he eventually built an extension to the house and he bought a two-colour machine and he had a pretty successful little business that he ran for about 20 years. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** So, your family, they migrated here, did you say? \n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah, they migrated from Burma – Myanmar now – in the seventies before I was born. So, I'm very thankful that I got to grow up as an Australian and not have to grow up there. I have visited there once. I actually had a Zen Pencils meetup there, which is one of my best experiences that I've had. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** So, when you went back to Burma with Zen Pencils, have you got family still there?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** No. So my parents went back on a holiday. And I went back for a holiday, but, for tax purposes, I had a little Zen Pencils meetup there. I thought, no one's gonna come, no one in Burma is reading Zen Pencils webcomics. There wasn't a huge crowd there, but it was about 20 people that came and it was really awesome.\n\nJust to go back to the motherland with my parents, and they showed me around where they grew up and stuff like that. It was a good experience. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** Have you managed to publish any Zen Pencils over there? \n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Not Burma, no. There's been a Vietnamese edition, and there's been a Korean edition, a French edition and that's it. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** You talked about [the quotes in Zen Pencils] mainly being white dudes. Did that shift also how you choose to _draw_ anything, as far as representation of the people telling the story?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah, it made me broaden my scope. So, I was doing a lot more quotes from females. And I was drawing more diverse characters. Growing up in a Western country, that's how you're brought up. All my characters were white, all the people I was quoting were white. And you just step back and you look at it and go, ‘Yeah, that's totally right. Why am I doing that?’ \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** It’s amazing to hear about your home printing. \n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah. He worked with a finishing company who binded it and stapled it and guillotined it. They helped with some of my projects around uni. \n\n\n","bigText":"Dad's Print Shop","pullQuote":"He started off with a one-colour machine outta my bedroom, which was illegal.

I was going to a few meetings. But, they were older. And they were more interested in old comic strips and political cartoons, stuff like that, which I was not interested in. I mean I went to meetings in Melbourne quite a bit. Trying to be part of a community, but again, I was not the most social person and they're not my age at all. So that didn't work out. I did meet Jason Chatfield there, which I'll talk about later. So that was the main organization I thought would be my tribe, but that didn't really eventuate. \n\n**GC:** There's something I've seen reflected around newspaper comics and political cartooning around, I guess, context or history and the silo of those sorts of communities. Is that what you found when you were doing your newspaper strip? How did you interact with the newspaper comics people or cartoonists when you were doing the actual published strips? Did they give you feedback or positive inclusion?\n\n**GAT:** Yeah, they were nice about it. That's when I was doing ‘Dan and Pete’. And I joined the ACA in Melbourne. There were a few guys who were very nice and supportive. Some of them were doing their own little strips or webcomics and stuff like that. Jason was the most supportive, cause we're a similar age, and he's deep into that world of newspaper strips. \n\n**GC:** There’s black-and-white traditional political cartooning, and then you look at other things which aren't one-panel political comics, and there's this cognitive dissonance that occurs.\n\n**GAT:** Yeah. They're part of the same thing, but _not,_ at the same time.\n\n**Meg O’Shea:** They're cousins who don't like each other.\n\nYou said you were hoping that the ACA would be a tribe, so was finding community something you felt like you needed at some point? \n\n**GAT:** It's a good question. I've thought about it a lot since I've seen what you're gonna be asking me about. Thankfully, through Zen Pencils, I found people, but they were not Australian. They were other artists from around the world. A lot in America. I built up connections through Twitter, which is the beauty of social media.\n\nWhen I was in Melbourne, I was just fully in Zen Pencils. That was everything. It took up my whole life basically. And then I moved to Perth. There's a really good community here, but I haven't really had much to do with it, which is my own fault. Plus, when I moved back there was a pandemic and then we had our second kid, we had a second daughter. There's not really much time to do professional networking and stuff like that. \n\n**MO: **Was there something about being in Melbourne, away from your hometown, that made you feel like you needed to establish connection?\n\n**GAT:** Yeah, that's a good question. Thankfully I made a good group of friends through my work. So, I worked in newspapers in Melbourne for four to five years. And I was doing ACA meetings, they became acquaintances. I went to a few of their conferences. I just felt, ‘I'm sure there are other cartoonists around, maybe we should hang out or something.’ I made some weak attempts at trying to make friends, but I'm not the greatest at that. \n","bigText":"Networking With Other Newspaper cartoonists","order":11}},{"id":"interview_33","fields":{"number":33,"name":"Gavin Aung Than on Making a Webcomic Around Inspirational Quotes","id":"interview_33","Copy_rt":"**Gabriel Clark:** In the comics you were doing in the newspaper strips, and then also Zen Pencils, what are the themes that you're exploring? What are the sort of themes that you return to or you come back to when you're making these stories?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** The newspaper strips were just fun, superhero escapism stuff, more aimed at kids. But Zen Pencils was all about self-motivation and inspiration and building in my own knowledge of science and history, and just combining everything I loved, basically.\n\nZen Pencils is all about positivity. And joy, I guess. It's really helped a lot of people around the world. It's just basically inspirational quotes, but done in comics. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** Do you use inspirational quotes in your own life?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah, the origin of it was all kind of wrapped up in my own life, where I was questioning what I was doing. I just kept doing these two little strips in newspapers, which no one was really reading. And my newspaper job was not fulfilling at all.\n\nI had a few of my own quotes, and I was reading a lot of biographies and stuff like that, to motivate myself. So, my main kind of heroes that I used on the site: Bruce Lee was one of them. So, he's a classic hero for young Asian men around the world. He's got some quotes. Muhammad Ali's another one. His biography is really good. George Carlin, the comedian, I was really into his work around that time, so I did some of his quotes.\n \nI did stuff that I loved. They were helping me to actually just do it: do what I wanted to do, which is comics. They formed the basis of the first few Zen Pencils, and then people started sending me their favourite quotes. \n\nI was reading more history, biographies and scientists’ biographies. And it all coalesced into Zen Pencils, and it helped me personally. It helped me get over the hump of doing comics as a job. And it helped a lot of people.\n\n**Gabriel Clark:** It must feel remarkable to have someone communicate the impact of your work in a positive way like that.\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah, it's really been humbling and very nice. \n\n**Gabriel Clark:** Are there any stories around the messages you've received from readers?\n\n**Gavin Aung Than:** Yeah, there's been heaps.\n\nI did a strip about domestic violence, and a few domestic violence survivors said that it really helped them. I've done one about a closeted gay man comes out and I got a few messages from gay people saying that it really hit home.\n\n\n","bigText":"Making a Webcomic Around Inspirational Quotes","LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"status":"in_progress","storyType":["interview_"],"order":12,"storyBy":"Gavin Aung Than","card":true}},{"id":"interview_34","fields":{"number":34,"name":"Gavin Aung Than on The Bill Watterson Comic that Went Viral","id":"interview_34","order":13,"storyBy":"Gavin Aung Than","storyType":["interview_"],"status":"in_progress","card":true,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"bigText":"The Bill Watterson Comic that Went Viral","Copy_rt":"place holder\n"}},{"id":"interview_36","fields":{"number":36,"name":"Gavin Aung Than on Stylistic Mimicry","id":"interview_36","storyBy":"Gavin Aung Than","storyType":["interview_"],"status":"in_progress","card":true,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"bigText":"Stylistic Mimicry","order":14,"Copy_rt":"place holder\n"}},{"id":"interview_37","fields":{"number":37,"name":"Gavin Aung Than on ","id":"interview_37","storyBy":"Gavin Aung Than","storyType":["interview_"],"status":"in_progress","card":true,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"order":15,"Copy_rt":"place holder\n"}},{"id":"interview_38","fields":{"number":38,"name":"Gavin Aung Than on ","id":"interview_38","storyBy":"Gavin Aung Than","storyType":["interview_"],"status":"in_progress","card":true,"LongFormCards":["recwIZK3J2HD0zUeS"],"order":16,"Copy_rt":"place holder\n"}}],"publications":[{"id":"anthology_1","fields":{"status":["stub"],"Name":"Victoria Drug Scene","number":1,"publication_type":["anthology"],"stories":["recoh7nUvcftPjImB","rec55Fg94egq2XSEl"],"Notes":"need to add other artists.\n","associated_entities":["recBjEkRhUkDB72v1"],"ID (from associated_entities)":["artist_6"],"id":"anthology_1"}},{"id":"book_4","fields":{"status":["stub"],"Name":"Placeholder Book","number":4,"publication_type":["book"],"id":"book_4"}},{"id":"zine_5","fields":{"status":["stub"],"Name":"Placeholder Zine","number":5,"publication_type":["zine"],"id":"zine_5"}},{"id":"webComic_6","fields":{"status":["stub"],"Name":"Placeholder Webcomic","number":6,"publication_type":["webComic"],"id":"webComic_6"}}]}
